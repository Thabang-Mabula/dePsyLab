## General Information

dePsyLab (pronounced kind of like "dee-sci-lab") is a small web-app intended to help users with decision making. It does this by providing a guided journey through the process of creating a simplified decision matrix. A decision matrix is a form of analysis that prioritises options based on the extent to which they meet pre-determined criteria (visit https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_03.htm for more info).

This is my first, small porfolio-project written in Angular.

You can try out this app by visiting:

## Technologies Used

- Angular - version 12.1.2
- Bootstrap - version 5.1.3

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following pre-installed on your machine before attempting to run this app locally:

- Node version 14.17.3 or higher
- NPM version 6.14.13 or higher
- Angular version 12.1.2 or higher

### Steps

- Clone this repo
- Navigate your terminal to the base folder where you cloned the source code
- Install all the project's libraries by running the following command in the terminal: `npm install`
- To run it locally, simply run the following command in your terminal (in the same base folder): `ng serve --open`
  - The command should automatically open a tab in your default browser.
  - Otherwise, manually navigate the link specified by the Angular server using your browser of choice (it will be specified in the sentence starting with "\*\* Angular Live Development Server is listening on ...").

## Project Status

This project is on hold.

There are quite a few features that could be added, as well as <b><u>a lot</u></b> of refactoring that needs to be done. Due to time constraints though, I will no longer be making further changes to the code until further notice.
